This code is to make a autonomous robot move with a detected color line via OpenCV
This code takes a camera frame's width and creates a center. If the target is to the left or right of that center.

Then the robot moves towards the target. amazing stuff.
These variables are sent via pyserial and there is going to be a manual take over option I just haven't figured out how to do that.
